Once upon a time, there was a golden retriever named Max. Max was just a young
pup, barely a year old. He loved his life with his wonderful family, the 
Johnsons. They gave him a wonderful home to stay in, with plenty of treats and 
belly rubs. He even had a large back yard that bordered a forest, in which he 
could run free. One day he was running around in the yard when he spotted an 
orange cat. He chased the cat through the woods for what seems like minutes. 
But when he lost sight of the cat he realized he was lost. He tried to find his way back when he stumbled upon a carnival in the middle of the forest. 

Curious, Max ran over to the carnival. As he ambled in, he was almost trampled by a clown on stilts. Max yelped out of fear, and startled the clown, causing him to fall over. The clown knocked his head hard on the ground, and was blacked out. Max ran away as quickly as he could, hoping to avoid being held responsible for the accident. Eventually, he found a good hiding spot in a corner between two tents. His heart pounding, he waited there for what felt like hours, but was in reality only a few minutes. Loud noises and sounds of laughter started to come from the tent on his left, and Max's curiosity was piqued again. He snuck under the tent, and found himself watching a lion tamer stick his head in the lion's mouth. Excited, Max found himself running into the ring for a closer look. The lion tamer had removed his head from the lion's mouth. Then, the lion spotted Max,froze, and stared, and started to salivate and growl.
