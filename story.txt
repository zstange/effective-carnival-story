Once upon a time, there was a golden retiever named Max. Max was just a young
pup, barely a year old. He loved his life with his wonderful family, the 
Johnsons. They gave him a wonderful home to stay in, with plenty of treats and 
belly rubs. He even had a large back yard that bordered a forest, in which he 
could run free. One day he was running around in the yard when he spotted an 
orange cat. He chased the cat through the woods for what seems like minutes. 
But when he lost sight of the cat he realized he was lost. He tried to find his way back when he stumbled upon a carnival in the middle of the forest.
